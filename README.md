# PROVERBS APP

After creating the LEMONADE and ARTSPACE App from the google developers basic course,
i decided to create a project where i could use State, When expressions, buttons, modifiers to
create the first idea that popped into my head.

##What i learned
1. Creating Transparent Buttons
1. Stacking Boxes on top of one another
1. Setting height and width in modifiers
